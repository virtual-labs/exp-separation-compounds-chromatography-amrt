## Procedure

<h3>Preparation of the Column:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Place the column in a ring stand in a vertical position.</li>
  <li>A plug of glass wool is pushed down to the bottom of the column.</li>
  <li>Prepare slurry of silica gel with a suitable solvent &amp; pour gently into the column.</li>
  <li>Open the stopcock &amp; allow some solvent to drain out. The layer of solvent should always cover the adsorbent; otherwise cracks will develop in the column.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Adding the Sample to the Column:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Dissolve the sample mixture in a minimum amount of solvent (petroleum ether).</li>
  <li>Remove the solvent by placing the mixture in a rotary evaporator at a low temperature.</li>
  <li>Place the dry powder on a piece of weighing paper and transfer it to the top of the column through the funnel.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Developing the Chromatogram:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Attach a dropping funnel filled with petroleum ether onto the column.</li>
  <li>Add petroleum ether continuously from the funnel to the top of the column.</li>
  <li>Open the stopcock carefully.</li>
  <li>The components of the mixture run down the column forming two separate yellow bands.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Recovering the Constituents:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Continue running the petroleum ether till both the bands are eluted out separately.</li>
  <li>Collect the constituents in two different R.B flasks. (Ortho nitrophenol is obtained first, followed by para nitro phenol.)</li>
  <li>Evaporate the solvent by placing the mixture in a rotary evaporator.</li>
</ul>
