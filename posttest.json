      "question": "After performing a recrystallization, where are the impurities found?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "they evaporate",
        "b": "In the filter paper",
        "c": "On the surface of the pure crystals",
        "d": "In the filtrate"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Impurities do not evaporate in this process.",
        "b": "Only insoluble particles may remain here.",
        "c": "Usually, pure crystals are formed separately.",
        "d": "Correct. Soluble impurities remain in the filtrate after recrystallization."

      "question": "Gas chromatography is similar to?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Paper chromatography",
        "b": "HPLC",
        "c": "Column chromatography",
        "d": "TLC"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Paper chromatography is not similar in technique or mechanism.",
        "b": "HPLC is liquid-based and uses high pressure, while GC uses gases.",
        "c": "Correct. GC is conceptually similar to column chromatography but uses gas as the mobile phase.",
        "d": "TLC is a surface method, not column-based."

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "This refers more to GC, not column chromatography.",
        "b": "Not a solid-solid interaction.",
        "c": "This refers more to partition chromatography.",
        "d": "Correct. Column chromatography involves a solid stationary phase and a liquid mobile phase."
